The core focus of the [Intelligent Systems Lab (ISL)](https://intelsyslab.com/) is on developing novel reasoning and learning theories and algorithms, studying their impact on the wider community, and ensuring they are used in a responsible and safe manner. A primary aim of the ISL is to strengthen academia-industry linkages, moving cutting-edge technologies into production.

## Staff
The ISL comprises a core group of academic from the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine and industry experts. Partnerships with for-profit institutions are established through the signing of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs). Currently, the ISL has academic partnerships with researchers from Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA, Tallinn University, Estonia, Brandenburg University of Technology, Germany and Kyungpook National University in Daegu, South Korea.

## Application Spaces
Some of the work in the field of ISL is being applied to various areas, including policy and governance, robotics, SCADA systems, attack-resilient systems, digital twins, and AI-enabled software, such as vector databases, AI-enabled servers, and industrial operating systems (for more information, please refer to our GitHub repository)

## Information Dissemination
The ISL disseminates information through scientific publications, conferences, seminars and media.
