The core focus of the Intelligent Systems Lab (ISL www.intelsyslab.com) is to develop intelligent systems integrated enabling technologies. We adopt the definition of Enabling Technologies as "Innovations and/or methodologies that, alone or combined with associated technologies, provides means to generate giant leaps in performance and capabilities or drive radical changes in user or cultural capabilities." Our research, development and implementation process involves:

Generating novel knowledge and theories, and disseminating them to the scientific community for feedback
1. Implementing theories as prototypical systems and conducting in-situ studies
2. Working with stakeholders to deploy prototypes in real-world scenarios, monitoring outcomes and collecting data
3. Refining technologies and disseminating information to the wider public about their purpose, capabilities, and limitations while partnering with incubators for sector-specific applications
4. Partnering with multilateral organizations and national policy bodies to provide technical expertise and generate evidence-based policies
In the minor case, ISL partners with private institutions and organizations to service their AI, robotic, workshop and training needs. These initiatives are operated primarily with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the University of the West Indies, St Augustine. To track the development of our projects we adopt the Technology Readiness Level definitions and assumptions found [here](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/). Some of our projects are distributed as open-source under the attribution-noncommercial-sharealike license unless or otherwise stated.

## Staff
The ISL comprises a core group of academic and industry experts. Partnerships with for-profit institutions are established through the signing of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs). Currently, the ISL has academic partnerships with researchers from Tallinn University in Estonia, Brandenburg University in Germany, Rutgers University in USA, and Kyungpook National University in South Korea.

## Core Technologies
ISL is currently focused on developing the following intelligent-systems integrated enabling technologies:
1. Artificial Intelligence: Generation of mathematical theories and algorithms, their practical implementation into software and the construction of hardware processing systems
2. Autonomous Systems: The study of control theory and advanced decision systems and their applications to robotics, industrial, energy and software systems
3. Cold Atmospheric Plasma Systems: Research and design of novel cold atmospheric plasma systems in feedback with applications to chemical production, agriculture, food processing and water treatment.

## Information Dissemination
The ISL disseminates information through scientific publications, technical reports, conferences, seminars and social media.
